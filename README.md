# Advent Of Code Solutions 2022
 My very bad solutions for AoC 2022.
 
 This is my first advent of code, and it's been a pretty fun experience to try the problems and talk about them with other people. Unfortunately I'm using Java for this, because it's the language that I'm most comfortable reading file input in, even though the lack of freedom in dynamically using arrays has made some solutions harder than I imagine they would be in a language like Python or Lua.
